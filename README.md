## Simple JavaScript Operations

In this script, you'll learn how to perform various mathematical operations using JavaScript. The script covers basic arithmetic operations, user input, and age eligibility checks.

## Operations Included:

1. **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication:**

   - The script performs basic arithmetic operations using predefined variables (`num1`, `num4`, `num18`).

2. **User Interaction:**

   - Utilizes `prompt` to gather user input for their name, age, and two numbers.
   - Displays the user's name using `document.write`.

3. **Calculation Results:**

   - Outputs the result of adding two user-input numbers.
   - Displays the results of subtraction and multiplication operations.

4. **Age Eligibility Check:**

   - Asks the user for their age and checks if they are eligible to vote (age > 18).
   - Displays a corresponding alert message based on eligibility.

## Usage:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Observe the results of calculations, messages in the console, and interaction dialogs.
3. Experiment with the provided code to gain a better understanding of JavaScript operations.
